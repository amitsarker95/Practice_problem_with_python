<h3>An RNA string is a string formed from the alphabet containing 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'U'. Given a DNA string corresponding to a coding strand, its transcribed RNA string is formed by replacing all occurrences of 'T' in t with 'U' in u.</h3><br>
 <b>Given: A DNA string having length at most 1000 nt.</b><br>
 <b>Return: The transcribed RNA string of t.</b><br>

 <p>Write a program to store a list of contact names and telephone numbers, similar to the contact lists you might find on a mobile phone. The data needs to be stored in a file so that it is persistent – that is, the data available at the beginning of a new execution of the program is the same as at the end of the previous execution.</p>
 </li>
 
 <li>
  <p>
   Extend the program (problem 4) written for the previous exercise so that as new contacts are added, the program checks for duplicate names and numbers. If the new contact’s name is already in the database, the message “This person is already entered.” should appear. If the telephone number is already in the database, the program should display “This person’s telephone number is already in the database. This could be an error, or a second contact at the same company. Add anyway?” If the user enters “Y”, the contact is added.
